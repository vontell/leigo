## The tutorial
This application was created to support a "Universal Javascript" (aka Isomorphic) tutorial published on [Scotch.io](https://scotch.io):

## Want to know more about Node.js, React and Universal Javascript?
If you want to know more about Universal Javascript and improve your application even more (e.g. by adding Universal Data Retrival using REST APIs) I definitely recommend to read the chapter Universal JavaScript for Web Applications on my book [Node.js Design Patterns Second Edition (Packt)](https://www.nodejsdesignpatterns.com/):
